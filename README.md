📚 Library Management System (Python)
A modular, CSV-persistent library management tool built with a focus on clean code, system architecture, and employee interaction.

🚀 Overview
This project represents a transition from basic scripting to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It manages books, customers, and employees using a "Lego-brick" modular design.

✨ Key Features
Data Persistence: Uses pandas to manage and store data across three main databases: data_book.csv, data_customer.csv, and data_employee.csv.

Modular Architecture: Built using PascalCase classes (bookMaster, customerMaster, employeeMaster) and camelCase attributes for industry-standard readability.

Dynamic UI: A "Live" main menu that randomly displays a staff member's name and their current behavior/mood from the database.

Search Engine: Built-in search functionality to query the inventory by book name.

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x.

Library: pandas (for data manipulation).

Environment: VS Code with Git Version Control.
